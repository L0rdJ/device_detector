Welcome to DetectRight, next-generation Device Detection: all performance, no hype!
OK, maybe a little hype.

(Java JRE 1.6 and .NET 4.0 versions can also be downloaded from http://www.detectright.com/downloads.html)

Prerequisites
=============

PHP 5.2+ w/SQLite or PDO w/SQLite, and optionally APCCache, Memcache, MySQL, Zend Cache, or Redis (redis support is beta)
JSON optional, not required.


Installing:
===========
1) Copy the files into a suitable directory (for instance, above your public web directory).
2) Get a free data file from DetectRight.com (registration required) and put it somewhere visible
3) If the conf directory doesn't exist, create a conf directory, copy the config files there.
4) Customise the config files and point them to the Detectright directory and data file


	Suggested setup:
	
	/home/youraccount
				/detectright
					All DetectRight files
				/detectright/conf
					detectright.conf.php (mostly cache options here: APC is default)
				/detectright/admin
					admin interface for DetectRight that allows editing of SQLite file (beta)
				/public_html
					your website
					
	DetectRight would be accessed in your scripts thus:
		include_once("/home/youraccount/detectright/detectright.php");
		DetectRight::initialize("/fn/to/database");
		
		// DO CLEVER LIFE-ENHANCING STUFF HERE
		$profile = DetectRight::getProfileFromHeaders($_SERVER); 
		// or
		$profile = DetectRight::getProfileFromUserAgent($_SERVER)
		Detectright::close();
