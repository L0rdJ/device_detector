	Explanation of query database cache:
	====================================
	DetectRight works off an SQLite file database. In the Java build, this database is loaded into a memory resident SQLite database
	connection. While SQLite can do this in PHP, it can't share the resulting link across multiple accesses, which means
	all you've done is add a load of overhead.

	The database query is very similar in concept to MySQL's: hash the query and retrieve the results from a cache. This relieves
	the load if you've stored the database file on a network, or in the event of lots of traffic accessing the SQLite file.

	It does mean that if you replace the database file, you have to flush the cache.
	
	Should I use the query cache?
	=============================
	If you're running Heap Cache (e.g. using PHP internal memory), 
	the query cache still speeds things up, but requires much more memory.
	
	If your cache is located somewhere other than localhost: set to "false"
	(the overhead of multiple additional calls to the cache outweighs the relief of stress put on the SQLite file.)

	If you're using Redis, MySQL or memcached @ localhost, then this option improves performance.
	Note that this is dependent upon the MySQL or memcache server being appropriately configured.
	
	If you're using APC under vanilla PHP, this setting should be left "false".
	If you're using APC under Zend Server, this setting should be left "true".
	If you're using APC under HipHop PHP, this setting can be set to "true".
	
	Zend Studio Server has two extra caches: Zend Studio Shared Memory and Zend Studio Disk Cache.
	We have found that the performance of Shared Memory cache is disappointing, 
	and APC should be used in preference (even though technically they are pointing at the same thing!).
	Zend Studio Disk cache is effective though performs worse than the other cache options.
	
	Note about IIS/PHP/Wincache
	
	(WinCache is an APC substitute for PHP under IIS (APC doesn't work there).
	
	Though we have written a Wincache object, we have found wincache to be unusable for batch mode, partly due to its
	small maximum size. There have also been reports of flakiness. Certainly the data cache should be turned off for this
	configuration.
